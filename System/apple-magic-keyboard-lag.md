Solution to fix input typing lag on apple magic keyboards, or other bluetooth keyboard

- Hold down the Shift and Option keys ('Alt' on some keyboards) and, at the same time, click on the Bluetooth icon in the menu bar.
- Find your keyboard on the device list and select "Factory Reset"
- Confirm "remove" when prompted.
- Reconnect keyboard.

_I tried "resetting NVRAM and SMC" as Apple Support mentioned but didn't enough to solve. If the solution above doesn't solve the problem, please try to reset NVRAM and SMC before following the solution steps._
